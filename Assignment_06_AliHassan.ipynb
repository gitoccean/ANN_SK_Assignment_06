        "three hyperparameters commonly tuned in ANN training and describe their impact on the\n",
        "model's performance.**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter tuning is a critical process in training artificial neural networks (ANNs) as it directly influences the model's performance, accuracy, and ability to generalize to unseen data. Unlike model parameters, which are learned during training, hyperparameters are set before the training process begins and dictate how the learning occurs. Proper tuning of these hyperparameters can lead to improved model efficiency and effectiveness, while poor choices can result in underfitting or overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Importance of Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Performance:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Hyperparameter tuning helps in optimizing the model's performance on a specific task, ensuring that the model minimizes the loss function effectively. This leads to better accuracy and fewer errors in predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Generalization:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Tuning hyperparameters is essential for enhancing the model's ability to generalize from training data to unseen data. This is crucial for practical applications where the model encounters new inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Resource Efficiency:**\n",
        "\n",
        " By optimizing hyperparameters, one can achieve better performance without unnecessarily increasing computational costs or training time. Efficient tuning can lead to faster convergence and reduced training cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Commonly Tuned Hyperparameters**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Learning Rate:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** The learning rate controls the size of the steps taken during optimization. A small learning rate can lead to slow convergence, while a large one may cause the model to diverge or oscillate around the minimum. Proper tuning of the learning rate is essential for achieving a balance between speed and stability in training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Number of Hidden Layers:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** This hyperparameter affects the model's capacity to learn complex patterns. More layers can capture more intricate relationships in data, but too many can lead to overfitting, where the model learns noise rather than the underlying distribution. Finding the right number of layers is crucial for optimal performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Batch Size:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** The batch size determines how many training examples are processed before the model's internal parameters are updated. Smaller batch sizes can provide a more accurate estimate of the gradient but may lead to longer training times, while larger batch sizes can speed up training but may reduce the model's ability to generalize.\n",
        "Tuning these hyperparameters effectively can significantly enhance the performance of an ANN, making it a vital step in the machine learning workflow."

For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
